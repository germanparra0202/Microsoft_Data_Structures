The Recommendation System Directions
The goal of this system is to improve your experience when working in your shell.

1) Have a directory that contains the following files:
	- initialize.oy
	- login.py
	- login_funcs.py
	- ngram_class.py
	- predict.py
	- some sort of history data, this can be multiple files
2) Run the initialization script with the name(s) of the history data following it
	- ./initialize.py file1.txt file2.txt
	a) This will prompt the user to input the name of 3 directories. If the absolute path is
	   not found for the directory, then it will ask the user to input a different one
	b) Once the user has input 3 directories, the script checks the validity of the history
	   files. If there is an issue with the data, then it will state "No valid files provided".
	   If this is displayed, then run the initialization script again but with different 
	   files. It will not prompt the user to input directories again if this is the case.
3) There should now be 2 new text files. One is called directory_data.txt and the other is
   ngram_data.txt
4) Type "pwd" into the command line and copy the response
	- This should be the absolute path to the directory that all the files are stored in
5) Open login.py to edit and paste the absolute path into the line that says "cwd=''"
	- This is on line NUMBER and right under the comment that says #TODO
6) Open the .profile file from your home directory and paste the same path from the login.py
   script on a newline. Then put login.py at the end of the path
	- It should look like absolute-path-to-file/login.py
7) Now when the user logs in, the 3 directories will pop-up giving them the option to 
   immediately change to them by inputing a number or skipping it by inputting anything 
   else.
8) ADD_./predict.py_NOTES
