SOME NOTES
Cron Jobs:
	- run "crontab -e"
	- insert "0 * * * * full_path_to_command/command"
		- runs the command every hour

Run at Login:
	- edit "~/.profile"
	- at bottom, insert "full_path_to_command/login.py"	

PLEASE TRY THIS
	lmk if you are getting errors -coleen
	1) run "./login_test.py" in any directory
		- if that works, you should have a file called example_data.txt in 
		  the same directory
		- check and see if the example_data.txt is a dictionary with 3 keys
		  and 3 values, if not please lmk, none of the values should be empty
		- i chose 3 directories that i thought we would all have but that might
		  not be the case
	2) in your shell, run pwd to get the path
		- copy this to your clipboard
	3) edit login.py
		- paste that path into the quotes in " cwd = '' " (right under the TODO)
	4) run "./login.py"
		- it should give you 3 options, depending on the option chosen it should
		  move to that directory
			*i was getting a weird error but it still worked
	5) add the same "FULL_PATH/login.py" to the end of your "~/.profile" file
	6) try logging in again and see if the options pop-up
